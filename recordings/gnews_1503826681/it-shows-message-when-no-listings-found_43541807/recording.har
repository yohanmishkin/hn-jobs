You are excited about helping creators thrive and build a living around their content. You have strong customer empathy and a track record of building customer-facing products. You work iteratively, shipping often and measuring results. You enjoy a small team where bureaucracy is low but great communication and collaboration is essential. You don’t get hung up on the boundaries of front-end, back-end, dev ops – you do whatever it takes to deliver. You think in terms of architecture and love to stitch together all elements of the software lifecycle to deliver great software.

We’re looking for passionate C++ software developers with experience in GPGPU programming frameworks and technologies, such as OpenCL and CUDA, GPU based optimizations techniques, and modern 3D frameworks. Ideally, you&#x27;ve used the Qt-framework in past projects.<p>Because everything is still being built, we don’t have a career website, so it’s an excellent opportunity to be part of something new and rapidly growing. All parts of our startup are still moving and you’ll be able to drive and influence the direction of our company.<p>Please provide an up-to-date resume including sample code of previous work that you can share to Michael@theabstract.co.\",\"time\":1573126434,\"type\":\"comment\"}"

We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.<p>We&#x27;re a startup — we&#x27;re 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We&#x27;ve built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.<p>We&#x27;re focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.<p>We recently raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company ($523 million in funding to date.) We&#x27;re planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry. To do that, we&#x27;re looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you&#x27;re just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.<p>Our tech stack involves Ruby &#x2F; Rails and Javascript &#x2F; React Native. However, we&#x27;re not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we&#x27;re looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.<p>We&#x27;re actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we&#x27;re headed, and we&#x27;re searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.<p>Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.\",\"time\":1572624113,\"type\":\"comment\"}"

Product engineers are empowered to take on a user problem and chase down its solution to any part of the stack, working alone or coordinating other engineers in service of improving users&#x27; lives, without regard for internal silos or barriers.<p>The ideal product engineer has a wide variety of background experience and isn&#x27;t afraid to learn to use more technologies when needed, but also is comfortable deferring to experts within the team when their particular skills are required.<p>If you think this role is for you, please let us know of a problem you see in one or more of our products, and how you would improve it. All who submit a non-trivial answer to this challenge are guaranteed to have an interview with a member of our leadership team.<p>Drop us a line at producteng@balena.io with a CV and your answer to the question, as well as any other relevant info that makes you particularly suitable for the role. We appreciate non-standard backgrounds and encourage you to focus your material on the substance and not on formalities. We look forward to speaking with you!\",\"time\":1572638411,\"type\":\"comment\"}"

Citizenship is a job requirement.<p>We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, ghidra, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC&#x2F;ppc, MIPS, ARM&#x2F;Thumb&#x2F;AArch64, x86&#x2F;x64&#x2F;Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.<p>We don&#x27;t normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do.

The business model is paying our expenses by selling the app (around 3€ one-time) as well as business subscriptions (called Threema Work, same app but with MDM capabilities). There are no external investors, the company is fully self-funded (and will stay that way). We manage our own bare-metal servers (no cloud). Leading principles are always user privacy, end-to-end encryption and storing as little user data as technically possible. Around 5 million active users, mostly in Germany &#x2F; Switzerland. Clients include Daimler, Bosch and the Swiss government (no, there&#x27;s no backdoor). For technical details, see the crypto whitepaper: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threema.ch&#x2F;press-files&#x2F;2_documentation&#x2F;cryptography_whitepaper.pdf\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threema.ch&#x2F;press-files&#x2F;2_documentation&#x2F;cryptography_...</a><p>We&#x27;re a small team, almost all employees are developers (the 3 founders are also devs). Flat hierarchies, a lot of freedoms in how you work. Homeoffice day possible. The usual perks (private health insurance, standing desks, pinball machine, espresso machine). Good work&#x2F;life balance (nice bike trails and paragliding spots close to the office). And of course, Switzerland is generally a great place to work!<p>(Some keywords for the Ctrl+F people:) Programming languages we use at the company: Java (Android) &#x2F; C &#x2F; Objective C &#x2F; Swift &#x2F; Rust &#x2F; Python &#x2F; PHP &#x2F; TypeScript. The infrastructure runs on FreeBSD and Linux servers. Both apps (iOS &#x2F; Android) are fully native (no cross-platform frameworks). We also do a few things with WebRTC (webclient and calls).<p>With the Android position, you&#x27;d be the person responsible for the Threema Android app.<p>If you&#x27;d like to apply, you should have good German language skills. We could probably help with visa applications though, in case you&#x27;d need to relocate.<p>I think that&#x27;s about it. If you&#x27;d like to know more, let me know at db@threema.ch (or via Threema 43C98BNT). I hope I&#x27;ll be able to answer any questions :)\",\"time\":1572696872,\"type\":\"comment\"}"

We use recursive zk-SNARKs to compress historic state in Coda&#x27;s blockchain so that nodes don&#x27;t have to store all the data going back to the first transaction. Compare this to Bitcoin or Ethereum whose blockchains already have hundreds of GBs of data, and keep growing.<p>We&#x27;re excited about this tech because it allows all the nodes in a network to be full nodes (no SPV&#x27;s!) and enables applications that can use the entire blockchain embedded in a phone or a browser. We&#x27;re well funded and backed by some of the top investors in the crypto &#x2F; blockchain space.<p>I&#x27;m on the product team, and we&#x27;re looking for both product and protocol engineers - but you can find all the roles we&#x27;re hiring for here - <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codaprotocol.com&#x2F;jobs.html\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codaprotocol.com&#x2F;jobs.html</a>.

We&#x27;re going to fix that, and we&#x27;d like you to help.<p>We&#x27;re a semi-stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We&#x27;re well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.<p>Our team is composed of neuro-experts, open-source enthusiasts, audio&#x2F;DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going (but dedicated!) folks.<p>About You:<p>- You&#x27;re excited to design a service architecture that orthogonalizes the critical feedback loops that entangle our code, data, models, and products.<p>- You&#x27;re tired of organizations treating DevOps like an individual role instead of a company-wide practice.<p>- You&#x27;re a networks&#x2F;containers nerd who will turn us into networks&#x2F;containers nerds.<p>- You&#x27;ve witnessed the pains that result from fitting square AWS-provided-solution pegs into round in-house-problem holes. Conversely, you&#x27;ve also seen how NIH syndrome can drive teams down a rabbit hole whose endpoint is a shallow reproduction of an existing AWS solution that could&#x27;ve just been employed in the first place.<p>- You are familiar with the many idiosyncrasies of storing, streaming, and analyzing large volumes of dense signal data in the cloud (e.g. audio, video, domain-specific sensor data, etc.).<p>- You believe that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture, and that lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.<p>Our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language. This quarter, we&#x27;re tackling model evaluation as a CI process, pushing &gt;70TB of signal data (and our processes for manipulating it) into AWS, and developing a browser-based viewing&#x2F;analysis application for our signal data.

Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1.5+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]<p>Job positions:<p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don&#x27;t already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and&#x2F;or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well; with Pulumi and RedShift.)<p>- C#&#x2F;.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.<p>- Rust developer: you dealt with C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you&#x27;re still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You&#x27;re not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code&#x27;s API to be consumed by higher level languages.<p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You&#x27;re disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don&#x27;t look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.<p>- Desktop&#x2F;mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)<p>- SmartContracts&#x2F;blockchain developer: you&#x27;ve used&#x2F;developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble&#x2F;grin, DAI, etc<p>Important perk for all positions: all the code&#x2F;scripts you&#x27;ll write (being paid of course) will be opensource, at least for the first 3months.<p>Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com<p>PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead&#x2F;managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.<p>PS II: In case you&#x27;re only interested in joining part-time, note: I wouldn&#x27;t find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because resting is important).\",\"time\":1572627065,\"type\":\"comment\"}"

FlightAware Foresight is already used by some of the largest airports and airlines in the world to improve operational efficiencies on the ground and in the air. As a senior data scientist at FlightAware, you will work alongside talented developers, systems engineers, and analysts to design, evaluate and improve state-of-the-art machine learning models underlying both current and future Foresight products.<p>You would bring scientific rigor and statistical methods into a multi-disciplinary engineering group pushing the industry forward and tackling some of the hardest problems in this space. We train thousands of models on hundreds of thousands of CPU cores using datasets with hundreds of millions of examples, and we stream real-time flight data from around the world through these models running on multiple clusters in order to produce thousands of inferences per second. These models compute estimated runway landing and gate arrival times for commercial and GA flights around the world. FlightAware in general processes over 180 million incoming messages per hour from over 22,000 individual data feeds. You would bring a broad technical and engineering background with you, allowing you to design solutions that can scale and operate in this demanding environment.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone with a solid real-world track record of delivering complex machine learning systems in production that solve well-defined business problems. This is decidedly a senior-level role, although less experienced but truly exceptional candidates will be considered. We have no formal requirements about educational background; while a PhD is probably a plus, it&#x27;s not required, and we&#x27;re more impressed by real-world results. You need a nontrivial expertise in statistics, machine learning, statistical learning, and deep learning that goes beyond what a talented engineer might learn studying in the evenings for fun. You also need a solid engineering foundation; you wouldn&#x27;t be isolated from infrastructure and systems engineers but would be working with and alongside them.<p>FA is a small company (currently ~100 employees), but we&#x27;re not a startup. We&#x27;ve been around for over a decade and don&#x27;t rely on VC funding. Our Foresight team alone produces millions of dollars of revenue. The company is successful, profitable, and growing.

By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the sea for generations to come.<p>Watch our TV episode with Amazon CTO Werner Vogels here: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YZ_qJ5JFD3I\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YZ_qJ5JFD3I</a><p>Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect sea lice infestations, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time.

While other travel products start by asking departure&#x2F;return dates and exact airports, we instead help people at the very beginning of their trip planning process - when they typically only know a broad sense of where, when, and why they want to go. Some folks may just want a weekend trip to visit family, while others want to visit Japan but aren’t yet sure when or how long to go. Moonfish works by constantly ingesting and understanding flight prices and fluctuations (through a set of data partnerships with various travel companies), and then matching our users to the best flights we find on a daily basis (typically saving them 40-90% off typical prices).<p>We’re backed by top-tier investors including general partners from Accel, Wndrco, founder of ITA&#x2F;Google flight, founder of Opendoor, and execs from Airbnb, Facebook, and Twitter.<p>Open Role:<p>- Software Engineer: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1iZuC2sJv3jhjEbMq43QJW0PsJS_eoi0CHoRra5ctuY8\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1iZuC2sJv3jhjEbMq43QJW0Ps...</a>\",\"time\":1572642182,\"type\":\"comment\"}"

While other travel products start by asking departure&#x2F;return dates and exact airports, we instead help people at the very beginning of their trip planning process - when they typically only know a broad sense of where, when, and why they want to go. Some folks may just want a weekend trip to visit family, while others want to visit Japan but aren’t yet sure when or how long to go. Moonfish works by constantly ingesting and understanding flight prices and fluctuations (through a set of data partnerships with various travel companies), and then matching our users to the best flights we find on a daily basis (typically saving them 40-90% off typical prices).<p>We’re backed by top-tier investors including general partners from Accel, Wndrco, founder of ITA&#x2F;Google flight, founder of Opendoor, and execs from Airbnb, Facebook, and Twitter.<p>Open Role:<p>- Software Engineer: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1iZuC2sJv3jhjEbMq43QJW0PsJS_eoi0CHoRra5ctuY8\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1iZuC2sJv3jhjEbMq43QJW0Ps...</a>\",\"time\":1572642182,\"type\":\"comment\"}"

We use recursive zk-SNARKs to compress historic state in Coda&#x27;s blockchain so that nodes don&#x27;t have to store all the data going back to the first transaction. Compare this to Bitcoin or Ethereum whose blockchains already have hundreds of GBs of data, and keep growing.<p>We&#x27;re excited about this tech because it allows all the nodes in a network to be full nodes (no SPV&#x27;s!) and enables applications that can use the entire blockchain embedded in a phone or a browser.

Citizenship is a job requirement.<p>We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, ghidra, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC&#x2F;ppc, MIPS, ARM&#x2F;Thumb&#x2F;AArch64, x86&#x2F;x64&#x2F;Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD.

Building an elegant experience for a highly technical end-user, e.g., making it easy and intuitive for an ops engineer to get up and running in &lt;5 mins\\n2. Low-level distributed systems, e.g., building lightweight proxies that manage requests asynchronously and deal with things like caching and network failures\\n3.

Intercom is also the best team inbox for sales and support AND the leading choice for targeted outbound messages that deliver. Valued at over $1bn, Intercom has been ranked among the best on the Crunchbase unicorn leaderboard since 2018. In our 8 year history, we’ve built world class sales, marketing and R&amp;D functions, and published a number of books along the way (<a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.com&#x2F;books\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.com&#x2F;books</a>).<p>WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK FOR INTERCOM?\\nOur culture is open and friendly and inclusive - and this is something we are proud of. We are optimistic, passionate and positive. We like people who can stay focused and work hard and who are confident, yet kind and humble. We like to experiment, sometimes inventing things for the first time, but we stay pragmatic, starting small and simple in everything we do. We love people who genuinely want to learn and grow and take bets on high potential engineers on rapid trajectories.<p>We’re opinionated by default, for example we run LESS software (<a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;run-less-software&#x2F;\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;run-less-software&#x2F;</a>) and ship continuously (<a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;shipping-is-your-companys-heartbeat&#x2F;\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intercom.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;shipping-is-your-companys-hear...</a>).

Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1.5+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]<p>Job positions:<p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don&#x27;t already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and&#x2F;or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well; with Pulumi and RedShift.)<p>- C#&#x2F;.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.<p>- Rust developer: you dealt with C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you&#x27;re still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You&#x27;re not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code&#x27;s API to be consumed by higher level languages.<p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You&#x27;re disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don&#x27;t look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.<p>- Desktop&#x2F;mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)<p>- SmartContracts&#x2F;blockchain developer: you&#x27;ve used&#x2F;developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble&#x2F;grin, DAI, etc<p>Important perk for all positions: all the code&#x2F;scripts you&#x27;ll write (being paid of course) will be opensource, at least for the first 3months.<p>Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com<p>PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead&#x2F;managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.<p>PS II: In case you&#x27;re only interested in joining part-time, note: I wouldn&#x27;t find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because resting is important).\",\"time\":1572627065,\"type\":\"comment\"}"

We&#x27;re going to fix that, and we&#x27;d like you to help.<p>We&#x27;re a semi-stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We&#x27;re well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.<p>Our team is composed of neuro-experts, open-source enthusiasts, audio&#x2F;DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going (but dedicated!) folks.<p>About You:<p>- You&#x27;re excited to design a service architecture that orthogonalizes the critical feedback loops that entangle our code, data, models, and products.<p>- You&#x27;re tired of organizations treating DevOps like an individual role instead of a company-wide practice.<p>- You&#x27;re a networks&#x2F;containers nerd who will turn us into networks&#x2F;containers nerds.<p>- You&#x27;ve witnessed the pains that result from fitting square AWS-provided-solution pegs into round in-house-problem holes. Conversely, you&#x27;ve also seen how NIH syndrome can drive teams down a rabbit hole whose endpoint is a shallow reproduction of an existing AWS solution that could&#x27;ve just been employed in the first place.<p>- You are familiar with the many idiosyncrasies of storing, streaming, and analyzing large volumes of dense signal data in the cloud (e.g. audio, video, domain-specific sensor data, etc.).<p>- You believe that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture, and that lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.<p>Our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language. This quarter, we&#x27;re tackling model evaluation as a CI process, pushing &gt;70TB of signal data (and our processes for manipulating it) into AWS, and developing a browser-based viewing&#x2F;analysis application for our signal data. Come help us make the right decisions!<p>Contact jarrett@beacon.bio if interested.\",\"time\":1572644537,\"type\":\"comment\"}"

As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack.<p>If interested, please apply at <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;aquabyte&#x2F;\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;aquabyte&#x2F;</a><p>Learn more about Aquabyte at <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aquabyte.ai\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aquabyte.ai</a>.

FlightAware Foresight is already used by some of the largest airports and airlines in the world to improve operational efficiencies on the ground and in the air. As a senior data scientist at FlightAware, you will work alongside talented developers, systems engineers, and analysts to design, evaluate and improve state-of-the-art machine learning models underlying both current and future Foresight products.<p>You would bring scientific rigor and statistical methods into a multi-disciplinary engineering group pushing the industry forward and tackling some of the hardest problems in this space.

This is decidedly a senior-level role, although less experienced but truly exceptional candidates will be considered. We have no formal requirements about educational background; while a PhD is probably a plus, it&#x27;s not required, and we&#x27;re more impressed by real-world results. You need a nontrivial expertise in statistics, machine learning, statistical learning, and deep learning that goes beyond what a talented engineer might learn studying in the evenings for fun. You also need a solid engineering foundation; you wouldn&#x27;t be isolated from infrastructure and systems engineers but would be working with and alongside them.<p>FA is a small company (currently ~100 employees), but we&#x27;re not a startup. We&#x27;ve been around for over a decade and don&#x27;t rely on VC funding. Our Foresight team alone produces millions of dollars of revenue. The company is successful, profitable, and growing.

Then working on Quartus, Intel&#x27;s compiler for FPGAs, is for you.<p>You will work in a downtown Toronto location, with an amazing and diverse group of talented engineers, on some of the most intellectually challenging problems in the world, and your work will directly benefit areas like AI, telecommunications, healthcare, aerospace, finance and more.<p>I am looking to hire specifically for the Timing Analysis team, which is responsible for one of the most critical components in the Quartus compilation flow (all compilation decisions are ultimately aimed at making the resulting FPGA design faster, and to determine the impact of various decisions on speed you need a robust and efficient timing engine). My colleagues are hiring for other roles. Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents preferred.<p>Please feel free to ask any questions here in comments, or send a resume to evgeny dot osovetsky at my company name dot com.\",\"time\":1572622677,\"type\":\"comment\"}"

This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.<p>Kalepa&#x27;s team members have worked at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn. We are backed by IA Ventures.<p>More details here: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;company&#x2F;kalepa&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;460333-software-enginee...\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;company&#x2F;kalepa&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;460333-software-enginee...</a>.<p>Contact: paul.monasterio@kalepa.co\",\"time\":1572628113,\"type\":\"comment\"}"

The business model is paying our expenses by selling the app (around 3€ one-time) as well as business subscriptions (called Threema Work, same app but with MDM capabilities). There are no external investors, the company is fully self-funded (and will stay that way). We manage our own bare-metal servers (no cloud). Leading principles are always user privacy, end-to-end encryption and storing as little user data as technically possible. Around 5 million active users, mostly in Germany &#x2F; Switzerland. Clients include Daimler, Bosch and the Swiss government (no, there&#x27;s no backdoor). For technical details, see the crypto whitepaper: <a href=\\\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threema.ch&#x2F;press-files&#x2F;2_documentation&#x2F;cryptography_whitepaper.pdf\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threema.ch&#x2F;press-files&#x2F;2_documentation&#x2F;cryptography_...</a><p>We&#x27;re a small team, almost all employees are developers (the 3 founders are also devs). Flat hierarchies, a lot of freedoms in how you work. Homeoffice day possible. The usual perks (private health insurance, standing desks, pinball machine, espresso machine). Good work&#x2F;life balance (nice bike trails and paragliding spots close to the office). And of course, Switzerland is generally a great place to work!<p>(Some keywords for the Ctrl+F people:) Programming languages we use at the company: Java (Android) &#x2F; C &#x2F; Objective C &#x2F; Swift &#x2F; Rust &#x2F; Python &#x2F; PHP &#x2F; TypeScript. The infrastructure runs on FreeBSD and Linux servers. Both apps (iOS &#x2F; Android) are fully native (no cross-platform frameworks). We also do a few things with WebRTC (webclient and calls).<p>With the Android position, you&#x27;d be the person responsible for the Threema Android app.<p>If you&#x27;d like to apply, you should have good German language skills. We could probably help with visa applications though, in case you&#x27;d need to relocate.<p>I think that&#x27;s about it. If you&#x27;d like to know more, let me know at db@threema.ch (or via Threema 43C98BNT). I hope I&#x27;ll be able to answer any questions :)\",\"time\":1572696872,\"type\":\"comment\"}"
